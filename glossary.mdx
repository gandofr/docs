### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#acquirer-or-acquiring-bank)

\*\*Acquirer (or acquiring bank)\*\*The bank or payment service provider (PSP) that acquires the funds from an end user’s bank (the<u>issuer</u>) on behalf of a business (which is often called a merchant). Mangopay acts as an acquirer for platforms using its services, and also partners with other acquirers.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism-aml%2Fcft)

\*\*Anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)\*\*Regulations and rules which place obligations on payment service providers like Mangopay to implement measures that help ensure the money transacting through their system is legitimate. These measures include (but are not limited to) customer verification.AML/CFT regulations aim to prevent the misuse of the financial system for illicit purposes. Financial crime may take place in many forms, but the regulatory landscape of the payment industry tends to highlight the risks posed by two types of offense:

- **Money laundering**, which is the act of concealing the source of money acquired illegally in order to reinvest it in legal activities. Prior to money laundering, there is always an underlying offense to acquire the proceeds of criminal activities, such as fraud, tax evasion or the provision of illegal products or services. Money laundering also usually involves various techniques to disguise the origin of funds by layering transactions and diversifying intermediaries. The final stage of this process consists in integrating the laundered money with the perpetrators’ assets.
- **Terrorism financing**, which is the provision of funds with the intention of using them to commit a terrorist act or in the knowledge that they will be used for that purpose. The sources of these funds can be illegal or legal, including through online fundraising and organizations which appear legitimate.

Whereas money laundering aims to disguise the origin of tainted funds, terrorism financing is driven by the need to hide the recipients of the funds.AML/CFT is tackled by international bodies, such as the[**Financial Action Task Force**](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/). In Europe, AML/CFT is part of the work of the[**European Banking Authority**](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism), and the[**European Union**](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism-eu-level_en)has enacted a series of directives often referred to as AML or AMLD with a number (for example AML6, 6AMLD).

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#bank-wire)

**Bank wire**Movement of funds between a user’s bank account and their<u>e-wallet</u>, either entering the<u>Mangopay environment</u>as a<u>pay-in</u>or leaving as a<u>payout</u>.A bank wire is also known as a**wire**or**credit**or**bank transfer**, but the term bank wire is adopted at Mangopay to distinguish it from a<u>transfer</u>, which occurs between two e-wallets, within the Mangopay environment.A bank wire, whether a pay-in or a payout, is in reality a bank-to-bank movement, with Mangopay, a licensed<u>electronic money institution</u>, on one side and the user’s bank on the [**other.Bank**](http://other.Bank)[\*\* wire pay-ins\*\*](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/payment-methods/banking/bank-wire)at Mangopay refer to a kind of credit transfer, where the user asks the bank to “push” the funds to the recipient. The same is true of[**payouts**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/payouts), where Mangopay offers a wide range of local and international options for sending funds.These can be contrasted with debit transfers, or direct debits, where the payee’s bank “pulls” the funds with the user’s permission. Mangopay offers two schemes for[**direct debit pay-ins**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/payment-methods/banking/direct-debit): SEPA for EUR and BACS for GBP.Another important aspect in bank-to-bank transfers, for both pay-ins and payouts, is whether the banks are based in the same country, and whether the accounts are in the same currency or different ones.

#### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#local-bank-wires)

**Local bank wires**Bank wires between two bank accounts in the same currency and two banks in the same country are known as local or domestic. These operations are governed by the country’s banking authorities and are free of additional charges.

**SEPA zone**

In Europe, the[**single euro payments area (SEPA)**](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html)facilitates cross-border payments in euros by providing a single framework for all participating countries. The rules also require banks to apply the same charges as domestic payments. This means that no additional fees will be applied for a bank wire made in euros between two accounts located within the SEPA zone.

**Multi-currency transactions**

However, as soon as another currency is involved, then there is the potential for conversion fees to apply. Banks generally hold amounts of foreign currencies with partner banks in other countries, and they can use these to manage cross-border transactions for their customers. These negotiated partnerships involve costs, and some banks pass these costs on to their users.

#### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#international-bank-wires)

**International bank wires**International bank wires take place between banks in different countries or regions, and in different currencies. They are by nature more complex and involve more actors.For a bank to receive the funds, it needs to have an account open in that country. If it is not the case, then the bank has to pass via a partner bank, known as a correspondent bank, to complete the operation. This depends entirely on the bank’s size and activity, and the country and currency involved. There may indeed be several partners, functioning more like a network and based on a multitude of agreements. Furthermore, if a bank doesn’t have the necessary partnerships in place to complete the operation, it must source the services of correspondent banks which [do.International](http://do.International) bank wires that rely on the**SWIFT network**have three options for managing expectations for processing fees:

- **SHA** – The fees are shared between the remitter (sender) and the beneficiary
- **BEN** – The beneficiary bears all fees
- **OUR** – The remitter bears all fees

The SHA option is most commonly used, and means that fees may be debited from the amount of a given payment (in the case of both pay-ins and payouts).The amount of the fees applied varies enormously as it will be different for each bank. They are likely to be a fixed amount per transaction and of an amount less than €50 (or the equivalent in other currencies).

**Note – Cost-bearing available for USD payouts**For payouts in USD, Mangopay offers the possibility of using OUR to allow the platform to bear the cost of international payouts. This ensures your beneficiaries are paid in full.See the [**payouts**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/payouts) guide for details or contact our teams [**via the Dashboard**](https://hub.mangopay.com/) to activate.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#beneficial-owner-ubo)

\*\*Beneficial owner (UBO)\*\*An individual who owns or holds a power of control over a legal entity, either directly or via a holding company, usually by owning more than 25% of the entity’s share capital or voting rights.Beneficial owners are sometimes called ultimate beneficial owners, or UBOs, because of the possibility of indirect ownership. In Mangopay’s hosted KYC/KYB solution, the term[**person of significant control (PSC)**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#person-of-significant-control-psc)is used synonymously, with the same definition and [criteria.To](http://criteria.To) enable payouts, some types of legal users need to declare information about beneficial owners, which must be verified by Mangopay against document proofs, in compliance with AML/CFT regulations.A person is considered a beneficial owner of a legal entity if:

- They own more than 25% of the entity’s share capital
- They are a beneficiary of more than 25% of the entity’s share capital
- They exercise more than 25% of the entity’s voting rights

**Direct vs. indirect ownership**

Beneficial ownership can happen in two ways:

- **Direct ownership** means that the shareholding or power of control is in their name as a natural person.
- **Indirect ownership** means that the person holds more than 25% of the entity via another company.

The 25% refers to the entity being verified, and therefore indirect ownership must be calculated based on the person’s ownership of the holding company. The word ‘ultimate’ is used to refer to this notion of ownership even if via another holding, such as in the phrase ultimate beneficial owner (or UBO).For example, shareholders of a company being verified all have small capital holdings (of less than 25%) except for one company which owns 60%. This parent company is owned 40–60 by Person A and Person B respectively. Person A ultimately owns 24% of the company being verified, while Person B owns 36%. Only Person B is therefore considered a beneficial owner.

**Note – Indirect ownership can be through multiple holdings**Regardless of how many companies are between the entity being verified and the individual person, if they ultimately own more than 25%, they need to be declared as a beneficial owner.

**Other criteria**

A person may also be considered a beneficial owner of a legal entity in other circumstances:

- They are appointed corporate directors or nominee directors
- They are legal guardians of a minor
- They hold a significant shareholding, including of bearer shares which can be transferred anonymously

**Disclaimer**

Mangopay reserves the right to determine who is a beneficial owner of a legal entity based on the information and documents provided. The person may be someone who exercises a power of control via other means, such as through voting rights or control over the management, administrative, or executive bodies, or over the general meeting of its members.When no natural person can be identified according to the above criteria of holding more than 25% of the capital or voting rights, a legal representative may be considered as the beneficial owner. This exceptional case is also only possible in the absence of any suspicion.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#bank-identification-number-bin)

\*\*Bank identification number (BIN)\*\*A unique set of digits assigned to an<u>issuer</u>. The BIN typically comprises 6 or 8 digits and is used at the start of the card number (also called the primary account number, or PAN) on all cards issued by the bank or financial institution.The BIN can be used to determine the card’s issuer and country, as well as other information like the network or brand, debit type, and card product. Mangopay enables platforms to do this using the Look up metadata for a payment method endpoint.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#buyer)

**Buyer**A user making a purchase from a seller on a marketplace. In a typical marketplace workflow, the buyer makes a pay-in to their wallet to complete the transaction. Depending on the business model and integration, the platform may choose to hold the funds on the buyer’s wallet before triggering the transfer to the seller at a later stage, such as on order confirmation or fulfillment.

**C**

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#chargeback)

**Chargeback**The reversal of a pay-in back to the user because they contested it with their bank. A user may request a chargeback if, for example, the platform refuses to refund the payment, and Mangopay must comply with the bank’s request.When a chargeback happens, Mangopay automatically creates a<u>repudiation</u>for the contested amount and deducts it from the platform’s<u>Repudiation Wallet</u>. Mangopay also creates a<u>dispute</u>to manage the liability of the funds, which may or may not be contestable by the platform.For more information, see the[**Disputes**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/disputes)article.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#customer-initiated-transaction-cit)

\*\*Customer-initiated transaction (CIT)\*\*A transaction made in the presence of the cardholder, subject to<u>strong customer authentication (SCA)</u>with no exemption possible. In recurring payments, once the initial CIT is successful subsequent<u>merchant-initiated transactions (MITs)</u>can be processed.

### [**​**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/glossary#conversion)

**Conversion**A movement of funds where the currency of the debited funds is different from the credited funds.The transaction is converted at the market rate offered by Mangopay to all platforms. The platform is invoiced for conversions during the billing cycle at the client rate, which includes Mangopay’s markup.There are two types of conversion:

- **Instant** - Conversion executed without a quote, at the current rate
- **Quoted** - Conversion executed against a <u>quote</u> that previously locked in the rate

A conversion’s sell currency (debited) and buy currency (credited) are together referred to as a currency pair. They are often expressed one after the other, for example EURUSD refers to a conversion from EUR to USD.See the[**FX**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/fx)article for more information.

**Refund**The reimbursement of a single<u>transaction</u>. A refund is linked to the initial transaction, and each type of transaction can be refunded:

- Pay-in: Back to the user via the payment method of the initial transaction (if supported).
- Transfer: Reversal of a movement from one wallet to another inside the Mangopay environment.
- Payout: Back to the wallet of the user who requested the payout, exceptionally and only at the initiation of Mangopay.

At Mangopay, a**refund**is the reimbursement of**one single transaction**in the Mangopay sense – meaning one single pay-in, transfer, or payout – rather than the full chain of transactions from the end user’s perspective. For example, refunding a pay-in for an end user may also require a transfer refund if the initial transfer was automatically triggered by the initial pay-in.[**Learn more about refunds**](https://docs.mangopay.com/guides/refunds)
